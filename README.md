# hello-world1
Its a me, Rudi. I'm very young ... 33 ... and ... i like hotdogs ... vegetarian hotdogs ... hotdogs without sausage ... so i would say its a bun, but not like a hamburger bun, not such a round stupid-ass my-version-of-the-world-is-the-right-one-bun ... it's more like a hey-guy-whats-up-in-your-hometown-homie-bun ... a horizontal one, long and thin and mysterious. Yeah, now it's late, its five minutes before after, so i have to go, but ... i think, that you now, that we will see us again ... in the future ... maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, certainly not in the past and i hope that you will remember me, my bun and the secret code that i wrapped in this tiny conversation :)
